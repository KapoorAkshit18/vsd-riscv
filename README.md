Skill Development- RTL Designer			

“Do something immediately, keep doing it and suddenly you are doing something phenomenal”



 



	






Lets start with Team A with less focus on Team B initially

Roadmap:
 	Profecient in languages like Verilog, System Verilog,  and Tcl/Tkl
 	Solid Portfolio and Projects relevant to the industry
 	Hands On exposure to the industry tools like Cadence 
 	Complete Unfinished Projects 
 	Resume Building and Personality Development

Detailed Plan: August 2025
6-7 Hrs – RTL to GDS2 flow using open source tools
10 Hrs – Verilog
15 Hrs- SystemVerilog
30 Hrs-  Fixed for Gate Exam 
3 Hrs- ngSpice and Project Specific Concepts
24 hrs-Other Tools Guides
